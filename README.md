# Welcome to the 2dverse demo!




## The Metaverse for Everyone.
 
2dver.se was created when we realized that virtual digital spaces need a casual alternative to get mass adoption and real-life integration.
​
Current blockchain Metaverses are anything but casual. They take up your whole screen, demand your attention, and their mobile implementations are either buggy or nonexistent. They are designed to be "immersive", which was considered to be the "holy grail" of gaming.
​
But Metaverses aren't games. Metaverses are social experiences. Healthy social experiences should be a part of your life, not a replacement for it.
​
Our Metaverse is 2d-first because we choose to create a world that can be constantly experienced next to real life. Go to galleries as you shop for groceries. Chat on regular social media while talking to random strangers on a digital street.
​
Meet people while meeting people.
​
Walk from chain to chain seamlessly, by just reconnecting to another wallet.
 
2dver.se is a web3 engine for Reality Sidechains.
 
It is also a multichain Metaverse: The first chain is NEAR.
 
More info at https://2dver.se -- Try the demo at https://2dverse.org with your NEAR Testnet account.
 


The demo utilizes NEAR Protocol and Paras.id tech and was made for MetaBUIDL. It runs on the 2dverse engine (founded by decentricity.near), which envisions a unique metaverse experience with the following tenets:
A casual, mobile-ready Metaverse, all in your browser
A focus on social immersion with voice chats and text messaging
A multichain Metaverse with the potential to integrate multiple blockchains into its login and NFT standards so avatars can “walk from chain to chain”.

The demo island is a fully functional prototype. Here’s the suggested user flow for the hackathon context:
Log in with your NEAR Protocol wallet (at https://2dverse.org)
Create an avatar for your account
Walk around with your WASD / directional keys on non-touchscreen PCs, or with the joystick if on a touchscreen device (upper-mid-range mobile phones included). Find lands that already have Paras.id NFTs on them, or find empty land.
Click on NFT objects to view details in-world, and then jump over to Paras.id
“Buy” land, without sending any tokens. Note that land that is not owned by anyone is denoted in black within the minimap. Land you own is colored blue, and land owned by others is colored red.
Communicate with each other using Text Chat (press enter or press the message button on the top) or Voice Chat (allow the metaverse page to access your microphone, use the top left settings button to debug, and unmute the microphone icon)
Build on land that you own by pressing the “Edit” button while within the land. Make sure to put up some walls before you go to the next step, so you can put up your NFTs!
Add NFTs from Paras.id by going to the Wall Decorations icon, pressing the upload icon, copy-pasting a valid Paras.id URL of a (static image) NFT, choosing the NFT from the bottom of the pallet, and clicking on a wall. Saving your progress with the floppy disk icon and leaving the editor would put you back in the world with the NFT loaded.
    

Known bugs:
After buying or editing land, the avatar may need to leave the land and come back to be able to see the change of state.
Some devices might experience errors that crash the webapp, in which case please simply hit refresh on the browser.
We currently only support static image NFTs from Paras.id
